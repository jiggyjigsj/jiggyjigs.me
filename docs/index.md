## Applications

### Radarr

*Link: <https://radarr.video/>*

**Web Service** <https://movies.jiggyjigs.me>

**Description**: Radarr is an independent fork of Sonarr reworked for automatically downloading movies via Usenet and BitTorrent.

The project was inspired by other Usenet/BitTorrent movie downloaders such as CouchPotato.

### Sonarr

*Link: <https://sonarr.tv/>*

**Web Service** <https://tv.jiggyjigs.me>

**Description** Sonarr is a PVR for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new episodes of your favorite shows and will grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available.

### Tautulli

*Link: <https://tautulli.com/>*

**Web Service** <https://tautulli.jiggyjigs.me>

**Description** Tautulli is a 3rd party application that you can run alongside your Plex Media Server to monitor activity and track various statistics. Most importantly, these statistics include *what* has been watched, *who* watched it, *when* and *where* they watched it, and *how* it was watched. The only thing missing is "why they watched it", but who am I to question your 42 plays of Frozen. All statistics are presented in a nice and clean interface with many tables and graphs, which makes it easy to brag about your server to everyone else.

### SABnzbd

*Link: <https://sabnzbd.org/>*

**Web Service** <https://sabnzbd.jiggyjigs.me>

**Description** SABnzbd is an Open Source Binary Newsreader written in Python.

It's totally free, incredibly easy to use, and works practically everywhere. SABnzbd makes Usenet as simple and streamlined as possible by automating everything we can. All you have to do is add an .nzb. SABnzbd takes over from there, where it will be automatically downloaded, verified, repaired, extracted and filed away with zero human interaction. If you want to know more you can head over to our website: sabnzbd.org.

### NZBGet

*Link: <https://nzbget.net/>*

**Web Service** <https://nzbget.jiggyjigs.me>

**Description** NZBGet is a binary downloader, which downloads files from Usenet based on information given in nzb-files.

NZBGet is written in C++ and is known for its extraordinary performance and efficiency.

NZBGet can be run on almost every device - classic PCs, NAS, media players, SAT-receivers, WLAN-routers, etc. The download area provides precompiled binaries for Windows, macOS, Linux (compatible with many CPUs and platform variants), FreeBSD and Android. For other platforms the program can be compiled from sources.

### NZBHydra 2

*Link: <https://github.com/theotherp/nzbhydra2>*

**Web Service** <https://nzbhydra.jiggyjigs.me>

**Description** NZBHydra 2 is a meta search for NZB indexers. It provides easy access to a number of raw and newznab based indexers. You can search all your indexers from one place and use it as an indexer source for tools like Sonarr, Radarr or CouchPotato.

### Portainer

*Link: <https://www.portainer.io/>*

**Web Service** <https://portainer.jiggyjigs.me>

**Description** Portainer Community Edition is the foundation of the Portainer world. With over 2 billion downloads throughout its history, it’s a powerful, open-source management toolset that allows you to easily build, manage and maintain Docker environments. And it’s completely free. By choosing from a growing range of extensions (available through a simple, low cost in-app subscription) Portainer’s core functionality can be extended to become the ideal toolset to manage docker based environments for organisations of any size.
