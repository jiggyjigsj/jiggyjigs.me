**Description** Sonarr is a PVR for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new episodes of your favorite shows and will grab, sort and rename them.

### Tautulli

*Link: <https://tautulli.com/>*

**Web Service** <https://tautulli.DOMAIN.com>

**Description** Tautulli is a 3rd party application that you can run alongside your Plex Media Server to monitor activity and track various statistics. Most importantly, these statistics include *what* has been watched, *who* watched it, *when* and *where* they watched it, and *how* it was watched. The only thing missing is "why they watched it", but who am I to question your 42 plays of Frozen. All statistics are presented in a nice and clean interface with many tables and graphs, which makes it easy to brag about your server to everyone else.

### SABnzbd

*Link: <https://sabnzbd.org/>*

**Web Service** <https://sabnzbd.DOMAIN.com>

**Description** SABnzbd is an Open Source Binary Newsreader written in Python.

It's totally free, incredibly easy to use, and works practically everywhere. SABnzbd makes Usenet as simple and streamlined as possible by automating everything we can. All you have to do is add an .nzb. SABnzbd takes over from there, where it will be automatically downloaded, verified, repaired, extracted and filed away with zero human interaction. If you want to know more you can head over to our website: sabnzbd.org.

### NZBGet

*Link: <https://nzbget.net/>*

**Web Service** <https://nzbget.DOMAIN.com>

NZBGet is written in C++ and is known for its extraordinary performance and efficiency.

NZBGet can be run on almost every device - classic PCs, NAS, media players, SAT-receivers, WLAN-routers, etc. The download area provides precompiled binaries for Windows, macOS, Linux (compatible with many CPUs and platform variants), FreeBSD and Android. For other platforms the program can be compiled from sources.

**Description** NZBHydra 2 is a meta search for NZB indexers. It provides easy access to a number of raw and newznab based indexers. You can search all your indexers from one place and use it as an indexer source for tools like Sonarr, Radarr or CouchPotato.

### Portainer

**Web Service** <https://portainer.DOMAIN.com>

**Description** Portainer Community Edition is the foundation of the Portainer world. With over 2 billion downloads throughout its history, it’s a powerful, open-source management toolset that allows you to easily build, manage and maintain Docker environments. And it’s completely free.

### Jackett

*Link: <https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett>*

**Web Service** <https://portainer.DOMAIN.com>

**Description** Jackett works as a proxy server: it translates queries from apps (Sonarr, Radarr, SickRage, CouchPotato, Mylar, Lidarr, DuckieTV, qBittorrent, Nefarious etc) into tracker-site-specific http queries, parses the html response, then sends results back to the requesting software. This allows for getting recent uploads (like RSS) and performing searches. Jackett is a single repository of maintained indexer scraping & translation logic - removing the burden from other apps.
