Most importantly, these statistics include what has been watched, who watched it, when and where they watched it, and how it was watched. The only thing missing is \"why they watched it\", but who am I to question your 42 plays of Frozen. All statistics are presented in a nice and clean interface with many tables and graphs, which makes it easy to brag about your server to everyone else.

Portainer \u00b6 Link: https://www.portainer.io/ Web Service https://portainer.DOMAIN.com Description Portainer Community Edition is the foundation of the Portainer world. With over 2 billion downloads throughout its history, it\u2019s a powerful, open-source management toolset that allows you to easily build, manage and maintain Docker environments. And it\u2019s completely free.

Jackett \u00b6 Link: https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett Web Service https://portainer.DOMAIN.com Description Jackett works as a proxy server: it translates queries from apps (Sonarr, Radarr, SickRage, CouchPotato, Mylar, Lidarr, DuckieTV, qBittorrent, Nefarious etc) into tracker-site-specific http queries, parses the html response, then sends results back to the requesting software. This allows for getting recent uploads (like RSS) and performing searches. Jackett is a single repository of maintained indexer scraping & translation logic - removing the burden from other apps. Requires admin access.
